## Project Overview

This project focuses on training a biped robot to walk in a straight line using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning algorithm. The primary goal is to simulate human-like walking patterns in a robot by leveraging advanced reinforcement learning techniques. This endeavor encompasses the creation of a simulation environment, the design of a sophisticated reward function, and a detailed training process for the agent.

## Simulation Environment

The simulation environment is built using Simscape™ Multibody™, which provides a realistic physics-based simulation platform. This environment models the biped robot, including its physical properties, joint constraints, and the interaction between the robot's feet and the ground. The simulation is designed to closely mimic real-world dynamics, providing a robust testing ground for training the reinforcement learning agent.

The environment provides 29 observations to the agent, including the robot's torso position and orientation, joint angles, and velocities. These observations are crucial for the agent to understand its current state and make informed decisions to achieve the goal of walking in a straight line with minimal control effort[8].

## Reward Function Design

The reward function is a critical component of the reinforcement learning process, guiding the agent towards the desired behavior. For this project, the reward function considers several factors to simulate human-like walking:

- **Velocity Tracking**: Encourages the robot to maintain a consistent forward velocity.
- **Symmetry of Hip Angle and Leg Lifting**: Promotes a balanced and symmetrical gait, similar to human walking patterns.
- **Control Effort**: Penalizes excessive use of control inputs to encourage efficient movement[3][8].

This multi-faceted reward function ensures that the agent learns to walk in a manner that is not only effective but also closely resembles human walking, both in appearance and efficiency.

## Agent Training Process

The training process utilizes the DDPG reinforcement learning algorithm, a model-free, off-policy actor-critic algorithm using deep function approximators that can learn policies in high-dimensional, continuous action spaces. The training involves several steps:

1. **Initialization**: The agent is initialized with random weights, and the simulation environment is reset to a starting state.
2. **Observation**: The agent observes the current state of the environment, including the robot's position, orientation, and joint states.
3. **Action**: Based on the observed state, the agent decides on an action to take, which involves applying torques to the robot's joints.
4. **Reward**: After executing the action, the agent receives a reward based on the outcome, with higher rewards for actions that contribute to walking in a straight line.
5. **Learning**: The agent updates its policy based on the received reward, aiming to maximize future rewards.

This process is repeated for numerous episodes, with the agent gradually improving its ability to walk in a straight line through trial and error[8].

## Results and Evaluation

The project's success is evaluated based on the robot's ability to walk in a straight line using minimal control effort. The performance of the trained agent is compared against baseline models and human walking patterns to assess its efficiency and realism. The evaluation criteria include the smoothness of the gait, the symmetry of movements, and the overall control effort required.

The results demonstrate that the DDPG algorithm, combined with a carefully designed simulation environment and reward function, can effectively train a biped robot to walk in a manner that closely resembles human walking. This project not only advances the field of robotics but also contributes valuable insights into the application of reinforcement learning in complex, real-world tasks.
